LLVM and Clang sources.

github: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
license: Apache 2.0
license url: https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/LICENSE.TXT

Default version: v14.0.6

Building:
LLVM uses cmake and builds without major surprises. The only twist is that we
need host versions of llvm-tblgen and clang-tblgen which are not part of llvm
distribution so we need to build them on our own.
