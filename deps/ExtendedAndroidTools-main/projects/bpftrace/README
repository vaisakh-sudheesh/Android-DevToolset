Building:
- we need to tell cmake to use flex version that matches the lib and
  headers we have for Android. We set FLEX_EXECUTABLE to point to
  host executable built from the same sources as we use for Android.
- bpftrace links against stdc++fs which is not available in NDK as a standalone
  library. We provide an empty stub for linking purposes.
